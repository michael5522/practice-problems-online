Imagine you run a website that presents users with different coding challenges in levels Easy, Medium, and Hard, where
users get points for completing challenges. An Easy challenge is worth 5 points, a Medium challenge is worth 10 points,
and a Hard challenge is worth 20 points.

Create a function that takes in the number of each challenge level a user has played and calculates the user's total
number of points. Keep in mind that a user cannot complete negative challenges, so the function should return the string
"invalid" if any of the passed parameters are negative.
